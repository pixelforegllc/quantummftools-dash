# Contributing to QuantumMF Tools Dashboard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to QuantumMF Tools Dashboard as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/pixelforegllc/quantummftools-dash/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/pixelforegllc/quantummftools-dash/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Adding New Tools to the Platform

### 1. Tool Structure
```
tools/
└── your-tool/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── model.js
    │   ├── controller.js
    │   ├── routes.js
    │   └── middleware.js
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── components/
    │   ├── services/
    │   └── store/
    └── docs/
        ├── setup.md
        └── api.md
```

### 2. Implementation Steps

1. Backend:
   ```javascript
   // 1. Create Model
   const toolSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       // Your schema definition
   });

   // 2. Create Controller
   const toolController = {
       // Your controller methods
   };

   // 3. Define Routes
   const router = express.Router();
   router.get('/', toolController.list);
   ```

2. Frontend:
   ```javascript
   // 1. Create Component
   const ToolComponent = () => {
       // Your component code
   };

   // 2. Add to Navigation
   const routes = [{
       path: '/tool',
       component: ToolComponent
   }];
   ```

### 3. Documentation Requirements

1. API Documentation:
   - Endpoints
   - Request/Response formats
   - Authentication requirements
   - Rate limits

2. Setup Instructions:
   - Dependencies
   - Configuration
   - Environment variables

3. User Guide:
   - Feature description
   - Usage examples
   - Common issues
